Prospective Student Outreach

Hello {0} Admissions,

My name is <FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME>, and I am a rising senior at <SCHOOL_NAME>.
I have a 4.0 GPA, and am interested in applying to your school for the 2021-22 academic year. 

One of the most important things I'm looking for is a school that takes the 
time out to create a positive experience for each and every student. For this reason,
I'm emailing you to see if you could perhaps send me a large t-shirt bearing your school's
logo / emblem? 

My home address is 
STREET ADDRESS
CITY, STATE, ZIP

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing from you.
