    <p>Hello {0} Admissions,
        <br><br>
        My name is FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME, and I am a rising senior at SCHOOL_NAME.
        I have a 4.0 GPA, and am interested in applying to your school for the 2021-22 academic year.
        One of the most important things I'm looking for is a school that takes the 
        time out to create a positive experience for each and every student. For this reason,
        I'm emailing you to see if you could perhaps send me a large t-shirt bearing your school's
        logo / emblem?
        <br><br>
        My home address is <br><em>
        STREET_ADDRESS <br>
       CITY, STATE, ZIP </em>
        <br><br>
        Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing from you. 
        <br><br>
